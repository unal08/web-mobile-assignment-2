# Web-Mobile-AS2

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a dynamic Products Page application. The application is designed to fetch products from an API, display them in a structured layout with search and category filtering capabilities, along with a comprehensive pagination system.

## Repository Structure
- `index.html`: The HTML document providing the structure of the application, integrating Bootstrap for responsive design, Font Awesome for icons, and custom elements for our product display.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet responsible for customizing the look and feel of the page. It involves responsive designs, animation keyframes, and styling for various interactive components on the web page.
- `script.js`: This JavaScript file is the heart of the application's interactivity. It manages the API calls, DOM manipulations for displaying products, implements search functionality, category filtering, and pagination.
